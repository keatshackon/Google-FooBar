Success! You've managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda's evil organization,
and finally earned yourself an entry-level position as a Minion on her space station.
From here, you just might be able to subvert her plans to use the LAMBCHOP doomsday device to destroy Bunny Planet.
Problem is, Minions are the lowest of the low in the Lambda hierarchy. Better buck up and get working, or you'll never make it to
the top...

Next time Bunny HQ needs someone to infiltrate a space station to rescue prisoners, you're going to tell them to make sure
'stay up for 48 hours straight scrubbing toilets' is part of the job description. It's only fair to warn people, after all.

You survived a week in Commander Lambda's organization, and you even managed to get yourself promoted. Hooray!
Henchmen still don't have the kind of security access you'll need to take down Commander Lambda, though,
so you'd better keep working. Chop chop!

You got the guards to teach you a card game today, it's called Fizzbin. It's kind of pointless, 
but they seem to like it and it helps you pass the time while you work your way up to Commander Lambda's inner circle.

The latest gossip in the henchman breakroom is that "LAMBCHOP" stands for "Lambda's Anti-Matter Biofuel Collision Hadron 
Oxidating Potentiator". You're pretty sure it runs on diesel, not biofuel, but you can at least give the commander credit for 
trying.

Awesome! Commander Lambda was so impressed by your efforts that she's made you her personal assistant. 
You'll be helping her directly with her work, which means you'll have access to all of her files-including the ones on the 
LAMBCHOP doomsday device. This is the chance you've been waiting for. Can you use your new access to finally topple Commander 
Lambda's evil empire?
